That’s why it’s important for everyone to practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear masks in public settings. Masks provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people.\n\nThe masks recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.

Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples. Two tests allow you to collect your own sample at home (either a nasal swab or a saliva sample) but you will still need to send the sample to a lab for processing.\nLocations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live.

Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
